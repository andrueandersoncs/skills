# Workflow State Machine Simulation

Model supplied behavior as a static Mermaid state diagram for inspection and learning by default, with an optional graph-only, event-driven browser app in which users emit modeled events and watch the active state and transition update live. Neither output executes the target, performs its side effects, modifies its sources, or presents inferred behavior as observed runtime behavior.

## Inputs

### A. Target

A required inline or repository-relative workflow, procedure, algorithm, function, or skill in prose, pseudocode, source code, or Markdown. An entry point is also required when the source defines multiple operations. The target is read-only and authoritative for states, transitions, guards, actions, outputs, and errors.

### B. Scenario

Optional initial arguments, machine context, environment values, and expected external responses. Values the user does not supply remain symbolic; the machine model must preserve source-feasible outcomes as explicit events or finite event payloads rather than silently inventing them. When HTML is selected, the app must let the user emit those modeled choices.

### C. Supporting context

Optional available definitions for callees, procedures, data shapes, invariants, and external behavior. Relevant context accompanying a target path is required input, but it may explain rather than override the target; surface conflicts and preserve the target's behavior.

### D. Controls

Optional entry-point override, abstraction level, expanded or collapsed operations, focus area, initial scenario, event-name or payload overrides, repository-relative `.mmd` destination, interactive HTML companion request, and repository-relative `.html` destination. The default output is only `workflow-state-machine-simulation.mmd` at the active repository root. Generate HTML only when the user explicitly requests it; when requested without a destination, use the Mermaid basename with an `.html` extension at the same location. Revising the Mermaid destination, or the HTML destination when selected, requires explicit user authority.

### E. Optional canonical app template

When HTML is requested, the bundled [`assets/app-template.html`](assets/app-template.html) is the authoritative implementation and visual reference for the generated app. Its document structure, styling, graph renderer, event emitter, controls, tooltips, accessibility behavior, and runtime logic are read-only template invariants; only the embedded machine data block between `// MACHINE_DATA_START` and `// MACHINE_DATA_END` is target-specific.

## Outputs

### A. Mermaid state diagram

One Mermaid source file at the resolved `.mmd` destination, generated directly from the shared machine model and conforming to [`references/mermaid-diagram-spec.md`](references/mermaid-diagram-spec.md); the bundled [`references/workflow-state-machine-simulation.mmd`](references/workflow-state-machine-simulation.mmd) is the generated self-simulation reference. It is complete when a Mermaid renderer can display every modeled state, event-labeled transition, cycle, initial state, and terminal outcome without introducing a path absent from the shared model. It is static and does not claim to emit events or update live.

### B. Optional interactive state-machine artifact

When HTML is explicitly requested, one self-contained HTML file at the resolved destination, created from the canonical app template with only its machine data block replaced, that implements the same modeled machine and conforms to [`references/interactive-artifact-spec.md`](references/interactive-artifact-spec.md). It is complete when it opens without a build step or network access as a full-viewport graph app, exposes the events accepted by the active state, lets a keyboard or pointer user emit those events in the app, and updates the active node, traversed edge, and relevant inline state data live until every modeled terminal state is reachable. The visible interface contains only the graph and minimal floating graph controls; it has no website masthead, sidebar, inspector, history, context, legend, disclosure, or content panel. Do not create or modify an HTML file when HTML was not requested.

### C. Completion report

A concise response containing the Mermaid artifact path, target and entry point, modeled terminal outcomes, symbolic or unresolved behavior, Mermaid validation performed, and any bounded or omitted detail; identify Mermaid as static. When HTML was requested, also include its artifact path and validation method. It is complete when it distinguishes source-grounded behavior from scenario choices and does not claim that the target itself was executed.

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve the simulation contract

Read every input and determine the root operation, initial context, source identifiers, authority order, abstraction boundary, Mermaid path, whether HTML was explicitly requested, and the HTML path only when selected. If supporting context conflicts with the target, retain the target's behavior and record the conflict for the outputs. If the target or entry point is missing, unreadable, or ambiguous, stop before creating output and name the blocker. If the Mermaid destination exists without revision authority, or the selected HTML destination exists without revision authority, stop without changing any destination and request authority or another path. An existing unselected `.html` file is irrelevant and must remain untouched. This step is complete when one shared simulation contract, the Mermaid path, and any selected HTML path are fixed or a blocker has been reported.

### 2. Build the source-grounded machine

Map the target into a finite model of start, operation, decision, waiting, success, error, blocked, and truncated states; source-ordered transitions; the event that triggers each transition; guards and optional event payloads; material context reads and writes; intended side effects; returns; and errors. Assign every user-drivable transition an explicit event type; define each distinct type once, derive its name from source terminology such as `SOURCE_VALID`, and retain a readable event label. Represent a local call as a state or nested group at the chosen abstraction level, an undefined or external call as an opaque waiting state, a loop as a cycle, and recursion as a bounded summary rather than unbounded generated states. Never invent business rules, external responses, timing, or concurrency ordering. If missing information controls a transition, model each source-feasible outcome as an explicit event or payload choice and label its value symbolic. This step is complete when every reachable source transition has a modeled event and destination or an explicit blocked or truncated state.

### 3. Define event semantics

Set the initial active state and context, then determine the accepted event set for every state. Dispatching an accepted event evaluates only its allowlisted declarative guard, applies its declarative context updates, traverses the matching edge, and makes the destination active. When one event can produce multiple source-feasible outcomes, require a modeled payload choice or split it into distinct events rather than choosing silently. Intended external side effects remain labels on transitions and never run. When HTML is selected, an unaccepted event leaves the app unchanged and produces a brief in-graph rejection cue; **Reset** dispatches a reserved local reset event that restores the pristine state and context; and the app must not provide generic **Next**, **Back**, or timeline controls that hide the event model. This step is complete when every modeled transition has an explicit event and destination, every dispatch is deterministic for its event and payload, and no event can enter an undefined state; when HTML is selected, every modeled transition must also be reachable by emitting its event in the app.

### 4. Create the Mermaid diagram

Render the in-memory machine model according to the Mermaid diagram specification. Declare every state once with a deterministic Mermaid-safe alias, connect the initial pseudostate to the modeled initial state, render every transition once with its event type as the edge label, and connect each modeled terminal to a final pseudostate while retaining its terminal kind in the state label. Preserve branches, cycles, event names, and source order; do not add runtime context, controls, HTML-only interaction, or inferred transitions. Write the raw `stateDiagram-v2` source directly to the resolved `.mmd` path without a Markdown fence or prose wrapper. This step is complete when the Mermaid file is a static projection of exactly the shared machine model's states and transitions.

### 5. Create the optional graph app

If HTML was not explicitly requested, skip this step without creating, modifying, or validating any `.html` file. If HTML was requested, read the canonical app template completely, copy it to the resolved destination, and replace only the JavaScript value between `// MACHINE_DATA_START` and `// MACHINE_DATA_END` with the complete JSON-compatible machine model. Preserve every other template byte and do not redesign, restyle, restructure, simplify, or extend its HTML, CSS, graph renderer, event dock, controls, tooltips, accessibility behavior, or runtime logic. Supply source-grounded node coordinates in the machine data so the canonical renderer produces a clear left-to-right graph; the template derives bounds and browser metadata from that data. Encode target-derived strings safely for an embedded script and never add external packages, remote assets, network requests, executable target code, or target side effects. This step is complete when HTML is unselected and no HTML file was touched, or when the selected destination is a canonical-template copy with exactly one replaced machine data block, every accepted event can be emitted from its overlay, and no other file or surrounding page is required to use it.

### 6. Validate the model and selected outputs

Compare the shared machine model with the target and scenario, correcting omissions, impossible paths, fabricated values, and hidden truncation before validating the selected projections. Parse or render the Mermaid file with an available Mermaid CLI or library; otherwise perform static syntax and set comparisons and disclose that rendering was not run. Confirm one-to-one equality between the model and Mermaid state IDs, event-labeled transitions, initial state, cycles, and terminal outcomes. When HTML was requested, use browser automation when available to emit every accepted event, including every branch outcome and cycle, and verify graph updates, declarative context changes, reset, rejected-event feedback, keyboard operation, focus, pan, zoom, fit, full-viewport behavior, and reduced motion; otherwise perform static checks and disclose that live interaction was not run. At desktop and narrow widths, reject website chrome or persistent panels, compare the HTML with the canonical template after normalizing only the machine data block, and confirm that the embedded machine equals the shared model and that no HTML-only runtime behavior appears as a Mermaid transition. If any Mermaid syntax, render, model-parity, selected route, event, graph update, template-invariance, or cross-projection check fails, correct the applicable output and repeat validation. This step is complete when Mermaid passes and any selected HTML output passes, or the exact unresolved validation failure is reported without claiming completion.

### 7. Publish the simulation

Leave the validated Mermaid diagram and any requested HTML app at their resolved destinations and report the output contract. If validation is unresolved, report the failure and every selected output's status instead of presenting the simulation as complete. Otherwise report the Mermaid path, entry point, terminal outcomes, symbolic events or payloads, Mermaid validation method, and bounded or omitted detail; identify Mermaid as static. When HTML was requested, also report its path and validation method. Do not claim that the target ran. The workflow is complete when the Mermaid source is source-grounded and renderable or its unrendered status is disclosed; when any requested HTML app is source-grounded, mutually consistent, browser-usable, and non-destructive; and when the completion report states their evidentiary limits.
