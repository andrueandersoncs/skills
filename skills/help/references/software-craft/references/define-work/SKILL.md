# Define Work

## Inputs

The software request, available repository and product evidence, constraints, decision authority, and known success conditions.

## Method

1. Inspect available repository and product facts before questioning the user.
2. State the current best one-sentence outcome hypothesis and what remains uncertain.
3. Separate discoverable facts from human decisions. Research the facts; ask only the currently unblocked decision frontier, with a recommendation for each choice.
4. Classify the work:
   - **Probe:** one cheap experiment answers the central question.
   - **Bounded change:** the outcome and affected surface fit one implementation cycle.
   - **System change:** independent capabilities, public contracts, or costly commitments require a written design.
5. Explore materially different approaches only where the choice can change the outcome. Compare user value, feasibility, reversibility, and evidence.
6. Record:
   - user and outcome;
   - reason now;
   - observable success test;
   - binding constraints;
   - explicit non-goals;
   - unresolved decisions and cheapest evidence for each.
7. Obtain explicit agreement for subjective, architectural, or irreversible choices. Proceed directly on clear mechanical work.

## Output

One accepted, testable software outcome with explicit constraints, success evidence, and ownership for every remaining unknown.

## Done

The user and agent share one testable outcome, and every remaining unknown has an owner: research, prototype, implementation, or human decision.
