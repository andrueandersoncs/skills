# Author Agent Skill

Create a skill only when a recurring task needs guidance the model would not reliably infer.

## Method

1. Define the recurring outcome, intended callers, and evidence of completion. Keep project-private procedure in project instructions.
2. Inspect existing skills and choose one owner for overlapping behavior. Consolidate instead of adding another competing trigger.
3. Write a short, discriminating description that says what the skill does and when it applies.
4. Keep `SKILL.md` to shared decisions and constraints. Link mode-specific procedures, examples, schemas, scripts, and assets only where they become relevant.
5. Describe outcomes and decision criteria. Use exact sequences or numerical rules only when deviation causes a concrete failure.
6. Preserve the user's scope, permissions, repository conventions, and portable source facts.
7. Validate frontmatter, links, and host discovery. Exercise changed routing and behavior in fresh context; choose cases that expose a plausible mistake, and tighten only wording linked to an observed failure.

## Artifact context

When the requested artifact is a project-local verification skill, apply [the verification skill context](references/verification-harness.md) within this authoring workflow.

## Output

A created, consolidated, or revised skill with only the resources its workflow needs.

## Done

The skill routes on its intended request, avoids adjacent work, has one canonical source for each rule, and changes a target decision the model would otherwise miss. Use a fresh no-skill comparison when that last claim is uncertain.
