# Diagnose Problem

## Method

1. Stop unrelated implementation and preserve the original evidence. Redact secrets from logs and reports.
2. Build one fast, deterministic command or runtime scenario that can visibly fail for the reported problem. Do not propose a fix before this loop can go red.
3. Reproduce, then minimize the inputs, state, timing, environment, and affected layer.
4. Trace the bad value or control decision backward across component boundaries. Compare with a complete nearby working path.
5. State a short ranked set of falsifiable root-cause hypotheses. Test one variable at a time and record the result.
6. Add temporary instrumentation only where it distinguishes hypotheses. Tag and remove it after diagnosis.
7. Capture the minimal reproduction as a behavior-level regression test when practical.
8. Fix the earliest verified cause, not the last visible symptom. Run the focused loop, surrounding checks, and the original end-to-end scenario.
9. After three failed fixes, stop changing symptoms and question the architecture, contract, or reproduction model.

## Done

The original failure no longer reproduces, the causal explanation fits the evidence, and a meaningful guard detects recurrence.
